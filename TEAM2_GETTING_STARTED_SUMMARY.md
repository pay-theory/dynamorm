### 2. Core Components Built

#### Expression Builder (`internal/expr/builder.go`)
- ✅ Builds DynamoDB expressions from high-level conditions
- ✅ Supports key conditions, filters, projections, updates
- ✅ Handles all common operators (=, <, >, BETWEEN, IN, etc.)
- ✅ Manages attribute name/value substitution

#### Query Builder (`pkg/query/query.go`)
- ✅ Fluent API structure in place
- ✅ Query compilation logic
- ✅ Automatic Query vs Scan detection
- ⚠️ Missing some interface methods (see TEAM2_TASKS.md)

#### Type Converter (`internal/expr/converter.go`)
- ✅ Basic Go type to DynamoDB AttributeValue conversion
- ✅ Handles common types: string, int, float, bool, slices, maps
- ⚠️ Needs extension for complex types

#### Index Selector (`pkg/index/selector.go`)
- ✅ Smart index selection algorithm
- ✅ Query statistics tracking
- ✅ Cost-based optimization framework

### 3. Next Steps

1. **Fix Compilation Issues**
   ```bash
   # The query.go file has unimplemented methods
   # See TEAM2_TASKS.md for the list
   ```

2. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   # Once compilation is fixed
   go test ./pkg/query/...
   go test ./internal/expr/...
   ```

3. **Implement Missing Methods**
   - BatchGet, BatchCreate, Scan, WithContext, Offset

4. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Expression builder tests
   - Query compilation tests

### 4. Key Files to Review

1. **TEAM2_PROMPT.md** - Your complete mission and requirements
2. **TEAM2_TASKS.md** - Detailed task list and progress tracker
3. **TEAM_COORDINATION.md** - How to work with Team 1
4. **pkg/core/interfaces.go** - The contract between teams

### 5. Integration Points

You'll need to coordinate with Team 1 on:
- The QueryExecutor interface implementation
- Model metadata access
- Type conversion completion
- Error handling patterns

### 6. Development Tips

1. **Start Small**: Get basic queries working first
2. **Test Early**: Write tests as you implement
3. **Document**: Add godoc comments to public APIs
4. **Communicate**: Sync with Team 1 on interface changes

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check for compilation errors
go build ./...

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Format code
go fmt ./...

# Check for issues
go vet ./...
```

## Questions?

- Check TEAM_COORDINATION.md for communication guidelines
- Review the design docs (DESIGN.md, ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Ask Team 1 about core interfaces
- Update TEAM2_TASKS.md as you progress

Good luck building the best DynamoDB query experience in Go! 🚀
