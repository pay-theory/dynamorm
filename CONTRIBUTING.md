## Style Guide

### Go Code Style

We follow the standard Go style guidelines:

- Run `gofmt` on your code
- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Comment exported functions and types
- Handle errors appropriately

### Code Examples

```go
// Good: Clear function name and documentation
// CreateUser creates a new user in the database with the given attributes.
// It returns the created user with generated ID or an error if creation fails.
func CreateUser(ctx context.Context, name, email string) (*User, error) {
    // Implementation
}

// Bad: Unclear naming and no documentation
func cu(n, e string) (*User, error) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Tests

- Test real DynamoDB interactions
- Use Docker for local DynamoDB
- Cover edge cases and error scenarios

### Example Test

```go
func TestCreateUser(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   User
        want    *User
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {
            name: "valid user",
            input: User{Name: "John", Email: "john@example.com"},
            want: &User{ID: "123", Name: "John", Email: "john@example.com"},
            wantErr: false,
        },
        // More test cases...
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got, err := CreateUser(context.Background(), tt.input)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("CreateUser() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
                return
            }
            // More assertions...
        })
    }
}
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
