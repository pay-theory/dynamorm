# DynamORM Evidence Plan (Draft)

This document defines where “evidence” for DynamORM’s planning rubric is produced and how to regenerate it.

Evidence should be reproducible from a commit SHA and should not require hand-assembled screenshots where a command,
report, or CI artifact is possible.

## Evidence sources

### CI artifacts (preferred)

- **Unit coverage**: generated by `bash scripts/verify-coverage.sh` (uploads `coverage_lib.out`).
- **Lint**: `make lint` output.
- **Security scans**:
  - `bash scripts/sec-gosec.sh` (console + optional SARIF)
  - `bash scripts/sec-govulncheck.sh` (console output)

### Deterministic in-repo artifacts

- Controls matrix: `docs/development/planning/dynamorm-controls-matrix.md`
- Versioned rubric: `docs/development/planning/dynamorm-10of10-rubric.md`
- Roadmap mapped to rubric IDs: `docs/development/planning/dynamorm-10of10-roadmap.md`
- Threat model: `docs/development/planning/dynamorm-threat-model.md`

| QUA-3 | Coverage profile + summary | `bash scripts/verify-coverage.sh` |
| CON-1 | gofmt diff list | `bash scripts/fmt-check.sh` |
| CON-2 | Lint output | `make lint` |
| COM-1 | Multi-module compile output | `bash scripts/verify-go-modules.sh` |
| COM-2 | CI alignment check output | `bash scripts/verify-ci-toolchain.sh` |
| COM-3 / DOC-* | Planning docs verification output | `bash scripts/verify-planning-docs.sh` |
| SEC-1 | gosec output (optional SARIF) | `bash scripts/sec-gosec.sh` |
| SEC-2 | govulncheck output | `bash scripts/sec-govulncheck.sh` |
| SEC-3 | `go mod verify` output | `go mod verify` |
