# DynamORM Progress Summary - After Session 1

## Overall Progress 🎯

Both teams have made excellent progress in their first session. The foundation is solid, and the teams are ready to integrate their work to create a fully functional DynamoDB ORM.

## Team 1: Core Foundation ✅

### Completed
1. **Core Interfaces** - All interfaces defined in `pkg/core/interfaces.go`
2. **Model Registry** - Complete struct tag parser supporting all tags from STRUCT_TAGS.md
3. **Type System** - Bidirectional type conversion between Go and DynamoDB
4. **Error System** - Comprehensive typed errors with context
5. **Session Management** - AWS SDK v2 integration ready
6. **Basic Query Structure** - Query builder skeleton in place

### Strengths
- Clean, well-documented code
- Comprehensive struct tag support
- Thread-safe implementations
- Good test coverage for completed components

### Next Steps
- Implement actual DynamoDB operations (GetItem, PutItem, etc.)
- Integrate with Team 2's expression builder
- Create schema management package
- Implement transactions and batch operations

## Team 2: Query Builder 🚧

### Completed
1. **Expression Builder** - Basic implementation supporting common expressions
2. **Query Structure** - Fluent API design in place
3. **Index Selector** - Smart index selection algorithm implemented
4. **Type Converter** - Basic type conversion (may overlap with Team 1)

### Issues to Address
- Missing several interface methods (BatchGet, Scan, etc.)
- Compilation errors need fixing
- Reserved word handling not implemented
- Complex conditions (AND/OR) support needed

### Next Steps
- Fix compilation issues immediately
- Complete missing interface methods
- Enhance expression builder with advanced features
- Create integration interfaces for Team 1

## Integration Points 🔗

### Critical Coordination Areas
1. **Query Execution** - Team 1 needs Team 2's compiled queries
2. **Type Conversion** - Teams should use Team 1's converter
3. **Error Handling** - Consistent error patterns needed
4. **Testing** - Shared test models and integration tests

### Immediate Actions
1. Team 2 fixes compilation errors
2. Teams review each other's interfaces
3. Create integration test suite
4. Define query executor interface

## Architecture Status

```
✅ Complete    🚧 In Progress    ❌ Not Started

Core Layer:
  ✅ Interfaces
  ✅ Error Types
  ✅ Model Registry
  ✅ Type System
  🚧 Query Builder
  
Expression Layer:
  🚧 Expression Builder
  🚧 Query Compiler
  ❌ Reserved Words
  ❌ Complex Conditions
  
AWS Integration:
  ✅ Session/Config
  ❌ CRUD Operations
  ❌ Query/Scan
  ❌ Batch Operations
  ❌ Transactions
  
Schema Management:
  ❌ Table Creation
  ❌ Index Management
  ❌ Migrations
```

## Session 2 Priorities

### Team 1
1. Implement AWS SDK operations
2. Create schema management
3. Build transaction support
4. Integrate with Team 2's expressions

### Team 2
1. Fix compilation issues
2. Complete interface implementation
3. Add advanced expression features
4. Create executor interfaces

## Success Criteria for Session 2

By the end of Session 2, we should have:
1. ✅ All CRUD operations working with DynamoDB Local
2. ✅ Complex queries executing successfully
3. ✅ Integration tests passing
4. ✅ No compilation errors
5. ✅ Basic performance benchmarks

## Risk Areas

1. **Integration Complexity** - Teams need to coordinate closely
2. **Missing Features** - Several critical features not started
3. **Testing Coverage** - Need comprehensive integration tests
4. **Performance** - No benchmarks yet

## Recommendations

1. **Daily Standups** - Quick sync between teams
2. **Integration First** - Focus on getting end-to-end flow working
3. **Test Early** - Write integration tests as you go
4. **Document Decisions** - Keep track of design choices

## Timeline Check

- Week 1-2: ✅ Core foundation (mostly complete)
- Week 3-4: 🚧 Query builder (in progress)
- Week 5-6: ❌ Advanced queries (not started)
- Week 7-8: ❌ Index management (algorithm done, integration needed)

The project is on track but needs focused effort in Session 2 to maintain momentum.

**Next Session Starts With:**
- Team 2 fixing compilation issues
- Team 1 implementing AWS operations
- Both teams creating integration tests
