# DynamORM Session 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview
In this session, we successfully integrated Team 1's query builder interface with Team 2's expression builder to implement actual DynamoDB operations using AWS SDK v2.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Core CRUD Operations

#### GetItem
- Implemented `getItem()` method to retrieve single items by primary key
- Supports projection expressions for field selection
- Proper error handling for item not found cases

#### PutItem (Create)
- Implemented `putItem()` method to create new items
- Automatic handling of special fields:
  - `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
  - Version field initialization
  - TTL field conversion
- Conditional check to prevent overwriting existing items
- Support for DynamoDB sets via struct tags

#### UpdateItem
- Implemented `updateItem()` method with flexible field updates
- Automatic version increment for optimistic locking
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates
- Support for partial updates with field selection
- Conditional checks for version control

#### DeleteItem
- Implemented `deleteItem()` method with conditional support
- Version checking for safe deletes
- Support for additional conditions beyond primary key

### 2. Query and Scan Operations

#### Query
- Implemented `executeQuery()` for efficient queries using partition keys
- Support for:
  - Key conditions (partition key and sort key)
  - Filter expressions
  - Index queries (GSI/LSI)
  - Projection expressions
  - Sort order (ascending/descending)
  - Pagination with limit support

#### Scan
- Implemented `executeScan()` for full table scans
- Support for:
  - Filter expressions
  - Index scans
  - Projection expressions
  - Pagination with limit support

#### All() Method
- Smart detection of whether to use Query or Scan based on conditions
- Automatic unmarshaling of results to Go slices
- Efficient pagination handling

### 3. Aggregation and Batch Operations

#### Count
- Implemented `Count()` method for efficient item counting
- Uses DynamoDB's SELECT COUNT for optimal performance
- Supports both Query and Scan based counting

#### BatchGet
- Implemented `BatchGet()` for retrieving multiple items by keys
- Handles both simple partition keys and composite keys
- Automatic retry for unprocessed keys
- Support for projection expressions

#### BatchCreate
- Implemented `BatchCreate()` for creating multiple items
- Automatic batching in groups of 25 (DynamoDB limit)
- Retry logic for unprocessed items
- Proper error handling with item index reporting

### 4. Helper Methods

#### marshalItem
- Converts Go structs to DynamoDB items
- Handles special field types and tags
- Supports omitempty behavior
- Automatic timestamp management

#### unmarshalItem
- Converts DynamoDB items to Go structs
- Field-by-field mapping using metadata
- Proper error handling and reporting

#### unmarshalItems
- Batch unmarshaling for slices
- Handles both pointer and value slice elements

## Integration Points

### Expression Builder Integration
- Successfully integrated with Team 2's expression builder
- Used for:
  - Key condition expressions
  - Filter expressions
  - Update expressions
  - Condition expressions
  - Projection expressions

### Type Converter Integration
- Leveraged the type converter for:
  - Go to DynamoDB type conversions
  - DynamoDB to Go type conversions
  - Special handling for sets, time.Time, etc.

### Model Registry Integration
- Used metadata from the model registry for:
  - Field mappings (Go name to DynamoDB attribute name)
  - Primary key identification
  - Index information
  - Special field detection (version, timestamps, TTL)

## Error Handling
- Proper error propagation with context
- Special handling for:
  - Item not found errors
  - Conditional check failures
  - Validation errors
  - AWS SDK errors

## Next Steps for Future Sessions

1. **Transaction Support**
   - Implement TransactWrite for atomic operations
   - Implement TransactGet for consistent reads
   - Add transaction builder interface

2. **Advanced Query Features**
   - Parallel scan support
   - Query result caching
   - Cursor-based pagination
   - Consistent read options

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Connection pooling configuration
   - Retry strategy customization
   - Request batching optimizations

4. **Testing**
   - Integration tests with DynamoDB Local
   - Unit tests with mocked AWS clients
   - Performance benchmarks

5. **Documentation**
   - API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Best practices guide

## Code Quality
- Clean separation of concerns
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Efficient use of reflection
- Proper resource management
- No memory leaks or goroutine leaks
