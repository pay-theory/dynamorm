## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **For Executives**: Read `current-status-summary.md` for project status
2. **For Team Leads**: Start with `progress-report.md` for detailed status
3. **For Developers**: Go directly to your team's task file
4. **For Project Managers**: Use `jira-tickets-template.md` to track work
5. **For Architects**: Review `table-management-implementation-review.md` for design validation

## 📊 Task Priority Levels

- 🔴 **Critical** - Blocking other work, must be completed first ✅ ALL COMPLETE
- 🟡 **High** - Important features that should be prioritized
- 🟢 **Medium** - Enhancements and optimizations
- 🔵 **Low** - Nice-to-have features for future releases

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Review your team's task list
2. Check dependencies in the summary document
3. Create JIRA tickets using the templates
4. Coordinate with the other team on shared dependencies
5. Update task status as work progresses

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Current Status (2024-01-15)
- **Critical Tasks**: 2/2 (100%) ✅
- **High Priority**: 2.5/3 (83%) - Blog partially complete, payment done ✅
- **Medium Priority**: 0/3 (0%)
- **Total Major Tasks**: 4.5/8 (56.25%)
- **Project Status**: Alpha → Beta Ready

### Recent Achievements
- ✅ Team 1: Simplified table management (avoiding complex migrations)
- ✅ Team 2: Completed payment example with production features
- ✅ Both: Removed architectural risk with pragmatic decisions
- ✅ Table Management: Implementation aligns perfectly with proposal (A+ grade)

Track completion status by updating the checkboxes in each document:
- [ ] Not started
- [x] Completed

## 🤝 Cross-Team Coordination

Key synchronization points are documented in the summary. Major dependencies:
- Team 2 depends on Team 1's ~~CRUD operations~~ ✅ RESOLVED
- Team 2 depends on Team 1's UpdateBuilder for atomic operations
- Both teams need to coordinate on integration testing

## 🎯 Beta Release Criteria

- [x] Core functionality complete
- [x] Payment example fully functional
- [x] Table management implementation aligned with architecture
- [ ] Blog example fully functional (pagination pending)
- [ ] All tests enabled and passing
- [ ] Basic documentation available
- [ ] Performance baseline established

## 📝 Updating These Documents

When tasks are completed or new unfinished code is discovered:
1. Update the relevant team task file
2. Update the summary if priorities change
3. Add new JIRA ticket templates as needed
4. Notify the other team of any new dependencies
5. Update the progress report with completion status
6. Consider architectural implications (see table-management-proposal.md)
7. Create implementation reviews for major features

## 🏆 Notable Implementations

- **Table Management**: Exceptional implementation demonstrating mature architectural thinking
- **Payment Example**: Production-ready with comprehensive features
- **Core CRUD**: Clean implementation with proper error handling
