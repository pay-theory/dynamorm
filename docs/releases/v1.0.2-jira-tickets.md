## Epic: DynamORM v1.0.2 Critical Fixes

**Title:** DynamORM v1.0.2 Critical Issues Resolution  
**Type:** Epic  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:**
```
DynamORM v1.0.2 was released without running integration tests, resulting in multiple critical issues in production. This epic tracks all fixes required to make the library stable.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] Nil pointer dereference fixed
- [ ] Documentation updated with working examples
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline includes integration tests
```

## Story 1: Fix Nil Pointer Dereference

**Title:** Fix nil pointer dereference in DynamoDB client initialization  
**Type:** Bug  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Parent:** [Epic above]  
**Description:**
```
## Problem
Users experience nil pointer dereference on any DynamoDB operation due to improper AWS SDK v2 initialization.

## Root Cause
1. Documentation shows incorrect initialization pattern
2. AWS SDK v2 client not properly initialized without credentials
3. No nil checks on session/client usage

## Reproduction Steps
1. Initialize with: dynamorm.New(session.Config{Region: "us-east-1"})
2. Attempt any operation (Create, Query, etc.)
3. Observe panic

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add nil checks in session client usage
- [ ] Validate AWS configuration during initialization
- [ ] Return meaningful error instead of panic
- [ ] Add unit tests for initialization scenarios
```

## Story 2: Fix Integration Tests

**Title:** Update all integration tests to use correct initialization  
**Type:** Bug  
**Priority:** High  
**Parent:** [Epic above]  
**Description:**
```
## Problem
All integration tests use non-existent dynamorm.Config{} proving they've never been run.

## Affected Files
- tests/integration/query_integration_test.go
- tests/integration/update_operations_test.go
- tests/integration/batch_operations_test.go
- tests/integration/workflow_test.go
- tests/integration/migration_test.go
- tests/integration/migration_largescale_test.go

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update all tests to use session.Config
- [ ] All integration tests pass with DynamoDB Local
- [ ] Document any failing tests as separate issues
- [ ] Add README for running integration tests
```

---

## Story 3: Update Documentation

**Title:** Remove all incorrect initialization examples from documentation  
**Type:** Documentation  
**Priority:** High  
**Parent:** [Epic above]  
**Description:**
```
## Problem
Documentation shows non-working initialization patterns causing user confusion.

## Affected Areas
- README.md examples
- Getting started guide
- All code examples

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace all dynamorm.Config{} with session.Config
- [ ] Add working examples for different environments
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common errors
- [ ] Add prominent warning about v1.0.2 issues
```

---

## Story 4: Add CI/CD Integration Tests

**Title:** Add GitHub Actions workflow for integration tests  
**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** High  
**Parent:** [Epic above]  
**Description:**
```
## Problem
No automated integration testing allowed bugs to reach production.

## Requirements
- Run integration tests on every PR
- Use DynamoDB Local in CI
- Block merge if tests fail

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create .github/workflows/integration-tests.yml
- [ ] Tests run automatically on PR
- [ ] Clear test results in PR checks
- [ ] Documentation for CI setup
```

## Story 5: Improve Error Handling

**Title:** Add typed errors and defensive programming  
**Type:** Improvement  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Parent:** [Epic above]  
**Description:**
```
## Problem
Generic errors and lack of nil checks cause poor user experience.

## Requirements
- Define error types (ErrTableNotFound, ErrItemNotFound, etc.)
- Add nil checks throughout codebase
- Validate inputs before operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define error types in pkg/errors
- [ ] Replace string errors with typed errors
- [ ] Add validation to all public methods
- [ ] Unit tests for error scenarios
```

---

## Story 6: Add Environment Detection

**Title:** Auto-detect execution environment for better defaults  
**Type:** Enhancement  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Parent:** [Epic above]  
**Description:**
```
## Problem
Users must manually configure for different environments (Lambda, ECS, local).

## Solution
Detect environment and provide sensible defaults:
- Lambda: Use implicit credentials
- ECS: Use task role
- Local: Prompt for configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Detect Lambda via AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME
- [ ] Detect ECS via ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI
- [ ] Provide helper functions for common setups
- [ ] Documentation for each environment
```
