# Team 2 Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Your Mission
Complete the remaining DynamORM examples. You've already done great work - now finish strong!

## 📍 Where You Are
- **Blog**: ✅ Complete
- **Payment**: ✅ Complete  
- **E-commerce**: 60% done (missing orders, inventory, tests)
- **Multi-tenant**: 20% started (structure only)
- **Basic CRUD**: Not started (CRITICAL!)
- **IoT**: Not started (optional)

## 🎯 Today's Focus

### Task 1: Complete E-commerce (1-2 hours)
```bash
cd examples/ecommerce
```

1. **Implement handlers/orders.go**
   - Copy patterns from products.go and cart.go
   - Add order creation from cart
   - Include order status management
   - Show transaction usage

2. **Create handlers/inventory.go**
   - Stock checking
   - Inventory reservation with timeout
   - Optimistic locking example
   - Stock updates

3. **Add tests/**
   - Integration test for full purchase flow
   - Benchmark tests
   - Concurrent order tests

4. **Add deployment files**
   - docker-compose.yml (copy from blog)
   - SAM template
   - Update Makefile

### Task 2: Create Basic CRUD (2-3 hours)
```bash
mkdir -p examples/basic/{1-todo,2-notes,3-contacts}
```

Start with the simplest and build up:

1. **Todo App** (30 min)
   - Basic CRUD operations
   - Simple model
   - Clear comments
   - Step-by-step README

2. **Notes App** (45 min)
   - Add tags (sets)
   - Timestamps
   - Search functionality
   - Build on todo concepts

3. **Contacts App** (45 min)
   - Complex queries
   - Filtering
   - Pagination
   - Performance tips

4. **Master README** (30 min)
   - Learning path
   - Common patterns
   - Best practices

### Task 3: Complete Multi-tenant (if time)
Already started - just implement the code!

## 🔧 Pro Tips

### Copy These Patterns
From **blog example**:
- Handler structure
- Error handling
- Response format
- Test patterns
- Deployment files

From **payment example**:
- Transaction handling
- Idempotency
- Audit trails
- Lambda optimization

### Focus Areas
1. **E-commerce**: Show inventory management and transactions
2. **Basic CRUD**: Make it beginner-friendly with lots of comments
3. **Multi-tenant**: Demonstrate composite keys and isolation

## ✅ Definition of Done
Each example needs:
- [ ] Working Lambda handlers
- [ ] Unit & integration tests
- [ ] docker-compose.yml
- [ ] SAM deployment template
- [ ] Comprehensive README
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## 🏁 Get Started!
```bash
# Start with e-commerce
cd examples/ecommerce
# Check what's there
ls -la handlers/
# Start with orders.go
```

Remember: **Quality > Speed**. Make examples that developers will love to use as templates!

Good luck! 🚀
