# DynamORM Project Summary

## Project Overview

DynamORM is a powerful, expressive DynamoDB ORM for Go designed to eliminate the complexity of working with DynamoDB while maintaining its performance and scalability benefits.

## Design Documentation

1. **[README.md](README.md)** - Project overview and vision
2. **[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)** - Comprehensive API design and features
3. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Technical architecture and implementation details
4. **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** - 20-week phased implementation plan
5. **[COMPARISON.md](COMPARISON.md)** - Side-by-side comparison with raw SDK showing 80%+ code reduction
6. **[STRUCT_TAGS.md](STRUCT_TAGS.md)** - Complete struct tag specification

## Team Organization

### Team 1: Core Foundation
**[TEAM1_PROMPT.md](TEAM1_PROMPT.md)**
- **Focus**: Core interfaces, model registry, type system, basic CRUD
- **Timeline**: Weeks 1-3 (primary), then support role
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Project structure and CI/CD
  - Core DB and Query interfaces
  - Model metadata and struct tag parsing
  - Type conversion system
  - Basic CRUD operations

### Team 2: Query Builder & Expression Engine  
**[TEAM2_PROMPT.md](TEAM2_PROMPT.md)**
- **Focus**: Query builder, expression engine, index management
- **Timeline**: Weeks 3-8
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Fluent query API
  - DynamoDB expression compiler
  - Complex query conditions
  - Automatic index selection
  - Query optimization

### Coordination
**[TEAM_COORDINATION.md](TEAM_COORDINATION.md)**
- Timeline and dependencies
- Shared interfaces and integration points
- Communication protocols
- Success metrics and checkpoints

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Struct Tag Based Configuration** - Simple, idiomatic Go approach
2. **Fluent Query API** - Chainable methods for intuitive query building
3. **Automatic Index Management** - Smart index selection and optimization
4. **Type Safety First** - Compile-time validation wherever possible
5. **Zero Magic Philosophy** - Explicit, predictable behavior

## Target Outcomes

- **80%+ code reduction** compared to raw SDK
- **< 5% performance overhead**
- **100% type safety** at compile time
- **Intuitive API** that feels natural to Go developers
- **Production ready** with comprehensive testing

## Getting Started

Both teams should:
1. Review all design documents thoroughly
2. Set up Go 1.21+ development environment
3. Install DynamoDB Local for testing
4. Coordinate on shared interfaces
5. Follow the implementation timeline in ROADMAP.md

## Success Metrics

- Week 3: Basic CRUD and simple queries working
- Week 6: Complex queries and full type support
- Week 8: Index management and optimization complete
- Week 14: All core features implemented
- Week 20: Production-ready v1.0 release
